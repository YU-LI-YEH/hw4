1. XBee Controlled BB Car
PC/Python sends a RPC command though XBee (with position parameters) to reverse park a BB car.
The BB Car will park automatically according to the position parameters.
2. Line Following BB Car
Use OpenMV to detect a straight line.
Steer BB car to go forward and follow the line.
3. BB Car Position Calibration
Use OpenMV to scan the above AprilTag codes. We can use the scanned AprilTag to determine the viewing angle from OpenMV to the AprilTag surface.
Steer BB Car such that the car is facing directly and perpendicular to the AprilTag surface.
Use PING to measure the distance between BB Car and AprilTag surface.
